<p>Welcome to my site, "Kalevera" is my online handle you can also find me on twitter under the handle <a href="https://twitter.com/theoneravenous">@TheOneRavenous</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/Kalevera" class="btn btn-github"><span class="icon"></span>View on GitHub</a>. This website is for you to checkout my life, my resume, or open a discussion about almost anything. I am new to putting my life on the internet so, first things first, I had better start a blog, I warn you though my English grammar is atrocious and in reality I have no business writing. I plan to have three blogs going on this site. One dedicated to my passion of rock climbing, one on computer science, apps and projects, and one on just life and thoughts. On that note feel free to help me get better at writing by pointing out poor sentence structure or superfluous word usage (i.e. "this", "is", "the", etc...). Without further ado below are things that I have going on.</p>

<a id="rock-climbing" class="anchor" href="#rock-climbing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rock Climbing!</h3>

<p>So climbing, why even read what I have to say? Who am I? I am Roberto Vega I have been sport climbing for 11 years, like most of the professionals that climb it represents an outlet for me to let go of life, push myself, and enjoy the beauty of the outdoors, among other things climbing represent camaraderie, dedication, success, and failure. In my 11 years of climbing I have gone through what I call the climbing cycle multiple times, the cycle is simple there are climbing highs and climbing lows.</p>

<a id="personal-projects" class="anchor" href="#persoal-projects" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Personal Projects</h3>

<p>This section will mainly be for programming projects but from time to time will feature my work in mechanical engineering and desalination.</p><br />
<p>
    I currently don't have many public projects to display, I'm currently working on a parallax page design for a band website, as well as a SPA site for the same band. They will have the option to go live with either page that they like and if they choose to update their site late they will still have access to the other site.
</p><br />
          <p>
          My last and most recent project leverages the google tasks API, the project did not require much flexability so it is a simple application (relatively seaking) which requests authorization from the user to access the users google tasks, it then finds the first task list of the user and then populates that list onto the page. The application was integrated into an existing build for a magic mirror. The application I developed was to become apart of the overall application.

I love technology, which has spurred me to switch careers into computer programming, and more specifically web app and mobile development. Through the use of the MEAN stack I have learned full stack development from application architecture, front-end user interface, third party web APIs, and use of my own API developed for Node.js environment (express specifically). 

My intermittent side project [http://roberto-san-box-114421.nitrousapp.com:3000/][rv] is sometimes online, currently this project leverages google maps API, JSON webtokens, cookies, SVG graphics, CSS3, HTML5, local storage, and custom APIs when I am not making additions or changes to the API you&#39;ll be able to visit the site using the above link. The above project is more of a sandbox as opposed to being a portfolio item.

##Experience

**Stormwater Specialist**, City of Pflugerville, *Current*

ipad, web, html, css, javascript

I&#39;m responsible for managing the City&#39;s Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4), this consists of anything man-made and natural that conveys stormwater through the City. 

To help the City and developers maintain environmental compliance with City and State regulation, I review and comment on design drawings. This entails conducting site development reviews for stormwater pollution prevention controls and design. Ensuring that the contractors have installed the correct controls and installed them properly. When non-comliance is noticed, I help to enforce the City regulations and help contractors come back to compliance. I manage environmental emergency response actions of City departments as well as manage reporting and interactions with state officials in such an event.

**Environmental Scientist**, Eclipse Environmental & Engineering, *May 2008 â€“ April 2015*

autocad, google-maps, web-applications

Initially I would source information from a myriad of agencies in order to aggregate enough environmental information about a project. Using this information our P.E. could make educated decisions on potentially costly environmental issues for our clients.  

I was eventually in charge of putting together project proposals, aggregating needed information, such as soil surveys, endangered species information, environmental impacts, field surveys and site drafting, planning, site development, and pollution prevention planning. I would deliver full projects to the P.E. for his review and subsequent approval or input where necessary. 

With the proper training I was able to go from an employee who performed one task and collected a pay check to an employee who was able to research, design custom solutions per project, and deliver on those solutions to the client which helped to bring more money to the firm as i was able to produce client specific solutions on my own.

**Environmental Scientist**, Hill Country Environmental, Inc, *January 2013 â€“ October 2014*

autocad, arcgis, vba, excel-vba, excel, word, visual-studio-macros

I aggregated environmental data in order to create pollution prevention reports, and provide custom solutions for clients specific pollution prevention needs. As a side project for the company I wrote C# code to help speed up the proposal process by using code to create bid documents. This entailed creating a language database, user interface, and functions which placed the relative bid text to the selected bid subject, it replicates address information found multiple times in a bid document. This program would allow workers who are not familiar with bid documents or bid language to create a bid document for a client when new bids were in queue.

**Austin Node School Mentor**, Austin Nodeschool, *Current*

nodejs, javascript, express

I became a Mentor in late 2015 after being apart of the Austin Nodeschool Meetups for a year. I was responsible for coming up with solutions to the Nodeschool tutorial and explaining the tutorial to the Nodeschool audience. I helped attendants with questions or setup, as well as helped them write their solutions to the tutorial. I was responsible for presenting the tutorial and explaining why the solutions work and what they do. Additional topics included JSONwebtokens, cookies, URLs and URIs.

##Education

**B.S. Mechanical Engineering Technology**, Texas Tech University Whitacre College of Engineering, *2007 â€“ 2011*

autocad, welding, cnc, solidworks, milling, lathe, integrated-circuits, thermodynamics, material-science, machine-design

My achievements aren&#39;t related to school, but to life&#39;s little happenings. I was the first in my family to get a college degree. I once saved a girl from drowning after she fell off of a cliff into water. I&#39;ve climbed 5.12c multiple times in the past three years.
