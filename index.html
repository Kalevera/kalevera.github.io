        <p>Thats me on the right. This is a side project to show my progress in learning the Mean Stack. I currently program in my spare time and was intersted in devloping applications which are mobile first and cross platform. "Chef of the Day" is to show I can learn programming as well as implement multiple layers of knowledge from front end devlopement, backend development and database management. Including working with external APIs to harness the power of other web services.</p>
